# ML-Regression-Model
This repository have one ipynb file which contains the analysis of weather dataset.
The dataset is already provided in the repository.

## Language and Libraries 
- Python 3 and above
- pandas => For Exploratory Data Analysis 
- numpy => to work with dimensions (arrays)
- matplotlib => to visualize the data, and look for pattern
- seaborn => to get over all analysis of data using graphs
- scikit-learn => to get different kinds of ML algorithms
- sqlite3 => to ingest data in to the jupyter notebook

## Machine Learning algorithms used 

- Linear Regression

## Software Required (Basic setup)
- IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks
- Python 3
- Conda for package management and virtual environments

If it is not able to install and run these software on the local system
then, online [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notbook can be used to do the same.
